            <p>Jaime Zepeda was born in Chicago on November 17, 1993. He lived the majority of his life in the city but
                eventually branched out to Winona Minnesota for his freshman year of college. Soon to realize the city
                is home, He came back to Chicago to later graduate from Roosevelt University with a degree in
                Computer Science.</p>
            <p>
                Jaime is taking the next steps in the broad Computer Science field by being enrolled in
                Northwestern’s Coding Bootcamp. He feels with the skills he has learned and the skills he will learn
                will help guide him to a career full of opportunities.

            <p>
                Jaime has always been a team player. From playing soccer his entire life, he grew to realize
                playing, or working, in a team environment is what is best for him. Teams can accomplish goals
                together more sufficient than by yourself. He does miss being on a competitive soccer team but does
                believe he can take that competitiveness to the workforce and strive for success.</p>
